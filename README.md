This code displays a 3d scene.
The program utilizes WebGL to create a scene that includes a table, chair, curtain, file holder, curtain rod, bookshelf, multiple books, multiple candlesticks, a basebaord, crown molding, a fan, a rug, pens, a pen holder, plants (ferns and trees), papers, a window, and a framed painting. Animation is also included. When the user presses the 'A' key, the fan rotates and the papers are blown off the table. Sound accompanies the animation. When the user presses the 'B' key, the animation is reset.
